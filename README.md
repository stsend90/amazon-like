# Bamazon

Created during UCF's Full stack Bootcamp 2019. The goal was to create an Amazon-like store front using Node.js and a MySQL database.

### What Each Does

1. `AmazonCustomer.js`

    * Prints the products in the store.

    * Prompts customer which product they would like to purchase by ID number.

    * Asks for the quantity.

      * If there is a sufficient amount of the product in stock, it will return the total for that purchase.
      * However, if there is not enough of the product in stock, it will tell the user that there isn't enough of the product.
      * If the purchase goes through, it updates the stock quantity to reflect the purchase.
      * It will also update the product sales in the department MySQL database table.

-----------------------

2. `AmazonManager.js`

    * Starts with a menu:
        * View Products for Sale
        * View Low Inventory
        * Add to Inventory
        * Add New Product
        * End Session

    * If the manager selects `View Products for Sale`, it lists all of the products in the store including all of their details.

    * If the manager selects `View Low Inventory`, it'll list all the products with less than five items in its StockQuantity column.

    * If the manager selects `Add to Inventory`, it allows the manager to select a product and add inventory.

    * If the manager selects `Add New Product`, it allows the manager to add a new product to the store.

    * If the manager selects `Exit`, it ends the session and doesn't go back to the menu.

## To do list.

1. Create a new MySQL table called `departments`. Your table should include the following columns:

   * department_id

   * department_name

   * over_head_costs (A dummy number you set for each department)

2. Modify the products table so that there's a product_sales column, and modify your `bamazonCustomer.js` app so that when a customer purchases anything from the store, the price of the product multiplied by the quantity purchased is added to the product's product_sales column.

   * Make sure your app still updates the inventory listed in the `products` column.

3. Create another Node app called `bamazonSupervisor.js`. Running this application will list a set of menu options:

   * View Product Sales by Department
   
   * Create New Department

4. When a supervisor selects `View Product Sales by Department`, the app should display a summarized table in their terminal/bash window. Use the table below as a guide.

| department_id | department_name | over_head_costs | product_sales | total_profit |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 01            | Electronics     | 10000           | 20000         | 10000        |
| 02            | Clothing        | 60000           | 100000        | 40000        |

5. The `total_profit` column should be calculated on the fly using the difference between `over_head_costs` and `product_sales`. `total_profit` should not be stored in any database. You should use a custom alias.

6. If you can't get the table to display properly after a few hours, then feel free to go back and just add `total_profit` to the `departments` table.

   * Hint: You may need to look into aliases in MySQL.

   * Hint: You may need to look into GROUP BYs.

   * Hint: You may need to look into JOINS.

   * **HINT**: There may be an NPM package that can log the table to the console. What's is it? Good question :)
